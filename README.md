The application is based on the classic Snake Game.

## Description

The application was developed to experiment and get familiar with JavaScript canvas. The game is based on the classic snake game, where you control a snake that increases in length every time it eats an apple. The snake can be moved in four different directions using a grid-style system. You can do everything you could in the classic snake game, plus I added a small leaderboard so that you can always try to beat your last score.
